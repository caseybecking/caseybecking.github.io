<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>I wanted to change up how a bio is written. I'm going to tell you about me, but not in the normal "here is what I've done" way. I'm going to tell you what I'm capable of by listing my strengths and detailing those out. If they align with what you are looking for, I'm that person.</p>
<p>I am Casey Becking. I'm adept at dealing with problems, great at figuring out what is wrong and resolving it. I take psychological ownership of what I say and do. I'm committed to stable values such as honesty and loyalty. I find deep satisfaction in working hard with colleagues to achieve a shared goal. I love to determine how all the pieces and resources can be arranged for maximum productivity. I have a great desire to learn and want to continue to improve, the process of learning and the outcome excites me. I make things happen by turning thoughts into action, I want to do things now rather than simply just talk about them and lastly I am introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions.</p>
